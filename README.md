# Hack-A-Thing-2

### Bailey Burke and Avery Vanacore

### CS98 Winter 2020

## What We did

We built a react native app simulating an interactive "To-do List." Bailey had never used or worked with React Native before, whereas Avery was first exposesd to it in hack-a-thing-1, so Bailey spent the first half learning the ins and outs of react native and getting to know the basic syntax, etc. This was a refresher for Avery, who also enlightened Bailey with the knowledge she learned 2 weeks prior, when necessary. Then Bailey got the app up and running, and implemented basic functionality, such as adding an input bar, adding the header, getting expo and xcode simulator to run, and getting code from the user input to be pulled as text into a different component of the app. Avery was an onlooker for all of this, and took over after the basics were implemented to add more complex functionality, building upon what she previously learned.  *ave you can add what you did*

## What We learned

Essentially every platform used for this project was new to Bailey, so React Native was used a new experience. It helps that it is pretty similar to React, but overall the basic structure of React Native was learned, such as the native components. It was also a refresher of some basic React concepts, like JSX, components in general, and props/the state. I kind of enjoyed how the styles are written directly in the JavaScript files. I had also never used simulator before, so that was a new experience.  

## What didn't work for us

What was initially challenging was just conceptualizing and remembering how React Native differs from React. The setup also provided some challenges. In the beginning, some of the code based on the tutorial threw an error, so had to be changed slightly. That took a bit of time to figure out.
